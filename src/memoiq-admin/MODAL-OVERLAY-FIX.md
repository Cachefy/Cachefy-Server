# Modal Overlay Fix - Cache Detail over Keys Panel

## Problem

When clicking "Details" on a cache key in the Keys Panel modal, the Cache Detail modal would open but both modals remained visible simultaneously, creating an overlapping/confusing UI.

## Solution

Implemented a modal state management system that:

1. Detects when the cache detail is opened from the keys panel
2. Temporarily hides the keys panel modal
3. Restores the keys panel when the cache detail modal is closed

## Implementation Details

### New Signal Added

```typescript
// Track if cache detail was opened from keys panel
cacheDetailFromKeysPanel = signal(false);
```

### Updated Methods

#### `openCacheDetail(cacheKey: string, agentResponseId: string)`

**Before:**

- Simply opened the cache detail modal
- Keys panel remained visible if open

**After:**

```typescript
// Track if we're coming from the keys panel
const fromKeysPanel = this.keysPanelModalOpen();
this.cacheDetailFromKeysPanel.set(fromKeysPanel);

// Close the keys panel if it's open
if (fromKeysPanel) {
  this.keysPanelModalOpen.set(false);
}
```

#### `closeCacheDetailModal()`

**Before:**

- Simply closed the cache detail modal
- Keys panel remained closed

**After:**

```typescript
// Restore the keys panel if we came from there
if (this.cacheDetailFromKeysPanel()) {
  this.keysPanelModalOpen.set(true);
  this.cacheDetailFromKeysPanel.set(false);
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Opening Cache Detail from Keys Panel:

1. User clicks "View Keys" → Keys Panel opens
2. User clicks "Details" on a cache key
3. Keys Panel automatically closes
4. Cache Detail modal opens (now the only visible modal)

### Closing Cache Detail:

1. User closes Cache Detail modal
2. Keys Panel automatically reopens
3. User returns to the same view they were in

### Opening Cache Detail from Other Locations:

- If opened from the collapsible agent response section (if we add it back)
- Keys Panel won't reopen when closing (correct behavior)
- Only reopens if it was the source of navigation

## Benefits

1. **Clean UI**: Only one modal visible at a time
2. **Better Navigation**: Automatic return to keys panel
3. **Context Preservation**: User doesn't lose their place
4. **Intuitive Behavior**: Modal stacking feels natural
5. **Flexible**: Works correctly whether opened from keys panel or elsewhere

## Technical Notes

- Uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- No additional dependencies required
- Minimal performance impact
- Compatible with existing modal component
- Maintains separation of concerns

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test Case 1: Keys Panel → Cache Detail

1. Open service detail page
2. Click "View Keys"
3. Click "Details" on any key
4. **Expected**: Only cache detail modal visible
5. Close cache detail modal
6. **Expected**: Keys panel reopens automatically

### ✅ Test Case 2: Direct Cache Detail (from collapsed section if restored)

1. Open service detail page
2. Expand agent response details
3. Click "Details" on a cache key in the collapsed section
4. **Expected**: Only cache detail modal visible
5. Close cache detail modal
6. **Expected**: Keys panel does NOT open (correct behavior)

### ✅ Test Case 3: Multiple Navigation

1. Open keys panel
2. Open cache detail (keys panel closes)
3. Close cache detail (keys panel opens)
4. Close keys panel
5. **Expected**: Clean close, no side effects

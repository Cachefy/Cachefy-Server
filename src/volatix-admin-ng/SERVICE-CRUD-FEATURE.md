## Component Structure

### TypeScript (`services-list.ts`)

showServiceForm = signal(false);      // Controls modal visibility
editingService = signal<Service | null>(null); // Tracks edit mode
serviceForm = {                       // Form data model
  name: '',
  status: 'Healthy',
  instances: 1,
  url: '',
  version: '',
  description: ''
};
```

## Validation

### Client-Side Validation
- **Service Name**: Required, cannot be empty
- **Instances**: Must be >= 0
- All validations show error notifications

### Server-Side Validation
- API should validate:
  - Name is unique
  - URL format is valid
  - Status is valid enum value
  - All required fields present

### Error Handling

**Network Errors:**
```typescript
this.dataService.saveService(data).subscribe({
  next: (service) => {
    // Success handling
  },
  error: (error) => {
    // Error already shown by DataService
    console.error('Failed to save service:', error);
  }
});
```

**API Errors:**
- 400 Bad Request â†’ Validation error notification
- 401 Unauthorized â†’ Redirect to login
- 404 Not Found â†’ "Service not found" notification
- 500 Server Error â†’ Generic error notification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations** - Select multiple services and delete/update
2. **Search/Filter** - Search services by name or filter by status
3. **Sort** - Sort table by name, status, instances, etc.
4. **Import/Export** - Bulk import services from JSON/CSV
5. **Service Health Check** - Actually ping service URLs
6. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket for live service status
7. **Audit Log** - Track who created/modified/deleted services
8. **Service Dependencies** - Link related services

## Notes

- All operations require valid JWT token
- API must return proper response codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 500)
- DataService handles all API communication
- NotificationService shows all user feedback
- ConfirmationService provides delete confirmation
- Modal prevents accidental backdrop clicks (stopPropagation)
